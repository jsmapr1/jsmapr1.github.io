<h1 id="who-am-i">Who Am I?</h1>

<p>I like things that are hard. I think things are fun in proportion to their difficulty and overcoming a challenge is the best feeling one can have. I also think you do not really understand something until you can make a joke about it.</p>

<p>I like to spend my time with problems that are hard and people that are awesome.</p>

<h2 id="things-that-are-awesome">Things That Are Awesome</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Functional Programming</strong>: The era of Moore&rsquo;s Law may be over. Concurrency is where it&rsquo;s at. Also, nothing feels better than a well executed reduce function.</li>
<li><strong>Javascript</strong>: This was the first language I really tried to study and master. You never forget your first love. When people hate it, it&rsquo;s because they are trying to make it something it&rsquo;s not.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>: Math is awesome. Statistics is like magic. I wish I knew more.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy</strong>: What is real and what can we really know? There are no problems seemingly more impossible than the ones that humans have been trying to solve for thousands of years.</li>
</ul>
