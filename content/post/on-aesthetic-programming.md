If you've spent any time reading mathematics, you've likely read an author refer to a beautiful proof.
The idea that proofs have beauty is deeply embedded in the field and likely goes all the way back to
an important book called [_A Mathematician's Apology_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology) which
compared mathematics to painting and poetry.

I think part of the reason that mathematicians bring it up so often is they are fighting a mass culture that devalues
mathematical insights, that considers math something boring and ugly and to be studied with the minimal necessity needed
to complete real tasks (i.e. accounting or engineering).
Mathematicians are fighting this and trying to convince the world there is value beyond the practical that certain
enterprises have value for their emotional appeal.

I think it's time for programmers to make the same statement.
This is not a novel idea.
There are books espousing the [beauty of code](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510046.do).
Entrepreneurs are selling depictions of (algorithms at high end art galleries) [https://www.artsy.net/auction/the-algorithm-auction].
And, if you include the idea of poetry and the written word as beautiful,
the idea that code can be beautiful stretch back to the sainted Donald Knuth's proposal of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

So why does the concept that code can be beautiful still sound a little odd even to the point that other [coders are arguing against it?](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-isnt-beautiful/)

I think it's the same as with math. There is a persistent belief that coders are not aesthetically minded individuals and thus anything they do is similar.
The cultural stereotype of a programmer is a pale, video game obsessed, loser that lives in their parents basement and never showers.
Usually a few other physical traits are thrown in (fat, bald, greasy-haired).
And always male.

The common theme is disgust.
Programmers aren't interested in beauty but instead are motivated by, well, I'm not really sure, usually some mixture of revenge and misanthropy.

The reality, of course, is very different.
I've met many programmers who know who John Cage is (possibly more than many librarians I've known).
Many are well read and are particularly found of modernist literature.
Quite a few are film buffs in the _400 Blows_ vein not just Marvel vein.
Music is extremely important and their tastes are way more diverse than average.
One of the most popular open source web projects is named after [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)).

Also, many love video games and science fiction and D&D
