      <description>Ok, ok. I know Angular 2 is still fairly new, but working with it has been&amp;hellip; an experience. There&amp;rsquo;s so much information that is out of date or just plain wrong. And that is doubly true of testing. No matter how important every claims testing is to modern development, it always lags behind.
Recent case in point, I was out interviewing for new jobs and after a few places gave me a spiel about how their developers are geniuses (aren&amp;rsquo;t they always) and how their products are amazing (ditto), I asked what testing suite they used.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently become convinced that Angular code can be significantly improved by eliminating the use of $scope and ng-controller. I started exploring this after a few coders I respect banned ng-controller from their own code. I&amp;rsquo;ve found the process to be very helpful for a few reasons. First, it will make the inevitable transition to Angular2 easier as they get rid of both ng-controller and $scope, but, even more importantly, it makes better code right now.</description>

      <description>I recently ran into an issue while testing an modal using Angular UI Bootstrap. My goal was to create a directive that will trigger a modal to open when clicked. The directive code is relatively simple:
app.directive(&#39;modalTrigger&#39;, [&#39;$modal&#39;, &#39;sharedData&#39;, function($modal, sharedData) { return { scope : { submitUrl : &#39;@&#39; }, link: function(scope, elem, attributes) { elem.bind(&#39;click&#39;, function() { $modal.open({ template: &amp;quot;&amp;lt;div another-directive&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, controller: &#39;AwesomeController as ac&#39;, resolve : { submitUrl : function() { return scope.</description>
